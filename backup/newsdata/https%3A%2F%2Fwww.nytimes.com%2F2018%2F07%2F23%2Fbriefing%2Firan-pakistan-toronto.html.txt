• An all-caps warning.
President Trump raised fears of a military confrontation with another foe, warning the president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, that he faced “CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED” if he continued to threaten the U.S.
The warning — issued after Mr. Trump returned, above, from his weekend away from Washington — came in response to Mr. Rouhani’s comment that any conflict with Iran would be the “mother of all wars.” He also threatened to disrupt oil shipments if U.S. sanctions blocked Iran’s exports. Oil prices briefly surged on the exchange, but then calmed.
Separately, the White House said that Mr. Trump is considering stripping security clearances from former national security and law enforcement officials who served in the Obama administration and have criticized him.

• Fears of poll violence in Pakistan.
Tens of millions of Pakistanis will go to the polls on Wednesday for a tightly contested national election that the military is shaping and several militant groups are violently opposing.

A string of election-related attacks, including a suicide bombing that killed more than 150 people and injured more than 170, has prompted the deployment of nearly 400,000 security officers. Even so, many wonder if voting will be safe.
The election will transfer power from one civilian government to another for only the second time in the country’s 70-year history. It pits an incumbent party, whose leader is in prison, against a rising party led by a former cricket player many see as allied to the military. Here’s what’s at stake.

• China’s latest pharmaceutical scandal.
Parents reacted with fury after reports that hundreds of thousands of Chinese children might have been injected with faulty vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.
While there have been no reports of deaths or illnesses related to the substandard vaccines, the news has rattled public confidence in the government and rekindled fears that corruption in the nation’s vast drug industry is placing ordinary people at risk.

• “Your concern is human rights, mine is human lives.”
That was President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines addressing “advocates of human rights” in his annual speech before Congress in Manila. Thousands of activists protested beforehand.
Had lawmakers been able to reach a deal ending the country’s yearslong Muslim rebellion, Mr. Duterte might have had a different topic. Instead, he used much of his third annual State of the Nation address to defend his deadly war on drug users and dealers.
Despite criticism from opposition leaders, the Catholic church and rights groups, Mr. Duterte remains widely popular.

What would Bella Abzug have to say about this year’s midterm elections in the U.S. and the surge of female candidates running for office?
Abzug herself used gender-based words to her advantage when she was first elected to Congress in 1970 with the slogan “This woman’s place is in the House — the House of Representatives!”
The New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist and lawyer was born on this day in the Bronx in 1920. She was the daughter of two Jewish immigrants from Russia.
Abzug, who represented the Upper West Side of Manhattan for three terms, supported the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion rights, child care legislation and more. And she wasn’t quiet about it. Among her nicknames: “Hurricane Bella” and “Battling Bella.”
Abzug, who died in 1998, “brought with her a belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national character.” People called her all kinds of things, including “a noisy woman” and a “man hater.” But Abzug was unapologetic.
“Our struggle today is not to have a female Einstein get appointed as an assistant professor,” Abzug once said. “It is for a woman schlemiel to get as quickly promoted as a male schlemiel.”
