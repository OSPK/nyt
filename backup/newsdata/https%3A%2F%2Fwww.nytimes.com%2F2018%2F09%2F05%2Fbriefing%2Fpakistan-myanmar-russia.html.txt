• “A born optimist.”
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Pakistan’s new prime minister, Imran Khan, in what the secretary said was an effort to smooth over tensions in a badly strained relationship. But the reset wasn’t without demands: Mr. Pompeo planned to press Pakistan on doing more to fight militants at home and in Afghanistan.
Both leaders came out of the talks sounding optimistic.
“A sportsman always is an optimist,” Mr. Khan, a former cricket star, told reporters. “He steps on the field and he thinks he’s going to win.”
Mr. Pompeo now heads to India for high-level talks on security cooperation. The U.S. is trying to build closer ties with India in a bid to check China’s growing influence, but the Indians are somewhat ambivalent, partly because of President Trump’s unpredictability.

• “The root of the problem is the president’s amorality.”
From Opinion: In an anonymous Op-Ed, a senior Trump administration official says he and other like-minded colleagues believe the “president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic” and are working to thwart “his misguided impulses.”
The account affirms the picture painted by the veteran journalist Bob Woodward’s new book, “Fear,” of a White House in disarray with officials actively blocking President Trump’s worst impulses. The administration hit back at the book, saying it was “nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the president look bad.”

On Capitol Hill, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, went before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a second day of hearings. Committee members pressed Judge Kavanaugh on his judicial independence, among other topics.
On the subject of abortion, Judge Kavanaugh said he would respect the Supreme Court’s “precedent on precedent.” Can the president pardon himself? “The question of self pardons is something I’ve never analyzed,” he said. Can a president be subpoenaed? “I can’t give you an answer on that hypothetical question.”

• American support for Burmese journalists.
Vice President Mike Pence expressed support for two Reuters journalists who were convicted of violating Myanmar’s colonial-era Official Secrets Act. The journalists were sentenced on Monday to seven years in prison in what was widely seen as an unjust case.

In consecutive Twitter posts, Mr. Pence said he as “deeply troubled” by the sentencing of journalists “for doing their job reporting on the atrocities being committed on the Rohingya people,” a reference to the mass killings of the ethnic minority.
He went on to say the reporters should be “commended — not imprisoned” for their work.

• A landmark ruling.
India’s top court is set to rule on whether to legalize consensual gay sex by overturning a law introduced by British colonial rulers in the 1860s, who made it part of the Indian Penal Code.
Over two dozen Indian petitions asked the court to overturn the law, pointing to the law’s long history as a cover for the blackmail, harassment, and sexual assault of gay and transgender Indians.
The ruling follows weeks of deliberation by a panel of five judges, who seemed to express sympathy during the hearings. One justice called homosexuality a “variation, not an aberration.”

• “This was not a rogue operation.”
The British authorities charged two men over a nerve agent attack, accusing them of being Russian agents sent to poison a former Russian spy. Prosecutors accused the men of attempted murder, the first criminal charges in a case that has caused an international uproar.
The police said they had tracked in detail the movement of the suspects, including security camera images that showed the two suspects leaving an Aeroflot flight, making their way to the scene of the crime and heading back to Moscow.

Also out of Moscow: The practice of luring Russians into informing on their fellow citizens, banned in the early 1990s, seems  to be widespread again. It took a while for a young woman, above, to figure out that the smiling man who asked her for coffee was trying to recruit her as an informer.

Hours after losing to Chris Evert in the semifinals of the U.S. Open, Martina Navratilova sat in a secret meeting with F.B.I. agents, where she declared her intention to defect from Czechoslovakia.

“I wanted my freedom,” Ms. Navratilova told reporters at a news conference on this day in 1975. She was 18.
The Czech tennis federation, under the Communist government’s rule, had exerted control over its young star’s schedule, finances and even her playing style. They had threatened to keep her from that year’s U.S. Open, saying she had become too “Americanized.”
Ms. Navratilova had not yet won any of her 18 Grand Slam singles titles. “I just felt that if I want to become No. 1, which I want to, that I couldn’t do it under the circumstances at home,” she told reporters.
She became the world No. 1 in 1978 and an American citizen in 1981. Ms. Navratilova was among the first openly gay professional athletes, but she said she waited until after she became a citizen to come out, fearing it might disqualify her.
Ms. Navratilova now carries dual citizenship, after regaining her Czech citizenship in 2008. By then, she had earned 59 Grand Slam doubles and singles titles.
