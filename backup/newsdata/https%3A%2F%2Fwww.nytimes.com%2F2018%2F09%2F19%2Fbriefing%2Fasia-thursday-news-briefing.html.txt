• Limited pledges from North Korea.
Kim Jong-un promised some concrete steps toward denuclearization, including dismantling facilities central to the production of fuel for nuclear warheads.
On Day 2 of a three-day summit meeting with South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, Mr. Kim also vowed to visit Seoul. He would be the first North Korean leader to visit the South’s capital.
But Mr. Kim stopped short of agreeing to denuclearize, saying that would happen only if the U.S. took “corresponding” measures, including formally declaring an end to the Korean War.
Today’s word is “warhead”: the part of the missile that actually explodes. North Korea’s weapons program is shrouded in secrecy, but experts believe it has fewer than 10 nuclear warheads.

• Freedom for Nawaz Sharif, for now.
The Islamabad High Court released the former prime minister of Pakistan and his daughter, above, from prison on bail as they appeal their corruption convictions.
In July, a lower anticorruption court sentenced the two to prison over the family’s luxury properties in London, which were disclosed in the so-called Panama Papers. They were also barred from seeking public office.

Their convictions rattled Pakistan and dented Mr. Sharif’s political party in general elections that his rival, Imran Khan, ended up winning.
If the Sharifs win their appeal, the political landscape could be upended again.

The typhoon that has been battering parts of Asia in the past week is named Mangkhut. What does the name mean, and why did the Philippines call the storm Ompong instead?
“Mangkhut” is Thai for mangosteen, a reddish-purple fruit native to Southeast Asia, pictured above. The longtime New York Times journalist and food writer R.W. Apple Jr. once wrote that he would “rather eat one than a hot fudge sundae.”

“Words can no more describe how mangosteens taste than explain why I love my wife and children,” he wrote in 2003.
The mangosteen, which has a hard shell with white flesh inside, is cheap and plentiful in Asia but rarer and more expensive in the West, where it is nonetheless growing in popularity.
The task of naming typhoons falls to the Japan Meteorological Agency, which uses names sequentially from a list suggested by different countries. But when typhoons enter the Philippines’s “area of responsibility” for monitoring storms, they are assigned a different name by the national meteorological agency, which has issued its own list each year since it was established in 1972. Thus, Mangkhut becomes Ompong.
Local names, the agency reasons, are easier to remember in rural areas and make the storms feel more immediate, increasing the chance that people will take them seriously.
