• Lawyers for President Trump demanded that the author Michael Wolff and his publisher halt the release of “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” and apologize, or face a possible lawsuit. The book includes derogatory remarks by Stephen Bannon, and others, about Mr. Trump and his family.
Critics of Mr. Wolff have previously raised questions about his reporting, but Mr. Bannon, a former presidential adviser, has so far not disputed his comments in the book. Sidelined by key allies, Mr. Bannon is now confronting the possibility of an unexpected fate: irrelevance.
Separately, our reporters have uncovered new information about Mr. Trump’s effort to hinder the special counsel’s investigation on Russia. Some legal analysts believe the president’s efforts could be seen as an obstruction of justice.

• In Turkey, Meral Aksener, above, has stepped up to challenge President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s increasingly authoritarian rule.
Ms. Aksener is already campaigning for early presidential elections, which she expects in July. Education and the economy are the key issues for voters, she told our Istanbul bureau chief.
Meanwhile, the conviction in the U.S. of a Turkish banker left Mr. Erdogan largely unscathed at home. Analysts said Mr. Erdogan’s government had successfully framed the case as a plot by his enemies.

•  Asel, above, was Vienna’s “New Year’s Baby,” the first child to be born in 2018 in the Austrian capital.
Instead of good wishes, the little girl and her Muslim family were greeted with a wave of racist messages online.
Those messages, however, were countered by an outpouring of support and love on social media. “It can be helpful to change the direction of the conversation online,” one observer suggested.

Back Story

Construction of the Golden Gate Bridge began on this day in 1933, more than 60 years after it was first proposed. Calls for a major thoroughfare connecting San Francisco to Marin County, to the north, began after the city’s population increased tenfold during the Gold Rush.
Before the bridge was painted its iconic international orange, architects also considered a proposal from the U.S. Navy for a striped design that would make the structure more visible to ships and airplanes.
The distinct reddish-orange hue was chosen to complement the bridge’s natural surroundings: the hills, the fog and the San Francisco Bay.
The city hired the engineer Joseph Strauss to build the 1.7-mile-long bridge, the longest and tallest of its kind at the time.

The bridge opened four years later to great fanfare. The Times called it “one of the greatest engineering structures of man,” and Mr. Strauss penned a poem, “The Mighty Task Is Done,” for the occasion.
“The bridge is a triumphant structure, a testimony to the creativity of mankind,” the historian Kevin Starr wrote in 2010, offering “enduring proof that human beings can alter the planet with reverence.”
