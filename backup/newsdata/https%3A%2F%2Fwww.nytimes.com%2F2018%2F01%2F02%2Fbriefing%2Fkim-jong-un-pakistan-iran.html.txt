• The Korean thaw appears to be moving rapidly.
South Korea is waiting to hear whether North Korea will agree to high-level talks next week, which Seoul proposed after an unexpected New Year’s outreach from the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un. It would be their first official dialogue in two years.
We’ve analyzed Mr. Kim’s speech. But his appearance — carefully coifed, in a Western-style suit — also made a statement.

• Iran’s supreme leader blamed the country’s “enemies” for the wave of deadly protests that have gripped the nation since last week.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been a target of the protesters, did not identify those foes, but said he would “speak to the dear people when the time is right.”

For hundreds of thousands like her, the horror isn’t over. More than half of the estimated 655,000 Rohingya refugees are minors, and perhaps one-third are younger than 5, like the girl being carried by her mother above. An aid official called it “the perfect breeding ground for a massive mental health crisis for children.”

• The reckoning over sexual harassment is reshaping U.S. culture.
Peter Martins, who led the New York City Ballet for more than three decades, stepped down, while rejecting accusations of harassment and physical and verbal abuse.
Gretchen Carlson, who spoke out against sexual harassment at Fox News, will lead the board of the Miss America pageant — a competition she won in 1989.
But our food critic, Pete Wells, says that revelations are playing out “excruciatingly slowly,” if at all, in the restaurant world.

Back Story

“Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy … how can I ever forget them?”
Those were Charles M. Schulz’s parting words in the final daily “Peanuts” comic strip, which ran 18 years ago today.
They recalled a slightly less sentimental line from the strip’s debut, nearly 50 years earlier, in which a carefree Charlie Brown strolls by a pair of children.
“Good ol’ Charlie Brown,” one says. “How I hate him!”
That juxtaposition of earnestness and wry humor made “Peanuts” a pop-cultural mainstay for half a century, reaching 75 countries in 21 languages at its peak.
Mr. Schulz, shown above in 1966, insisted on producing every aspect of the comic, making himself inseparable from his characters.
“I want it to be my words in everything I do,” he told The Times in 1967. “I’ve thought of it — hiring someone to help. Sometimes I think it would be nice. But then — what would be the point?”
When colon cancer forced Mr. Schulz to end the daily strip in 2000 at age 77, The Times invoked a dismal Charlie Brown, mourning the end of the baseball season: “There’s a dreariness in the air that depresses me.”
Mr. Schulz died a month later, but all 17,897 “Peanuts” strips would be anthologized over the next two decades.
