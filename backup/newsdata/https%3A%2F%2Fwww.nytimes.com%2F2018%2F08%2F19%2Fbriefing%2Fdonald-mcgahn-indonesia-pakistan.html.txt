• A cease-fire offer in Afghanistan.
President Ashraf Ghani extended a trust-building measure to the Taliban before the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha this week. He said the conditional cease-fire would start today and extend “until Nov. 21, birthday of the Prophet Muhammad.”
There was no immediate response from the Taliban, which has staged a charm offensive of sorts in advance of the Islamic holiday — even as the insurgents, in the past week alone, have overrun cities, burned down government facilities and killed hundreds of their opponents. Above, a checkpoint on the Ghazni-Kabul highway last week.
The U.N., meanwhile, urged all sides of the Afghan conflict to protect aid workers delivering critical assistance to a population suffering the brunt of war and drought.
And Rod Nordland, a Times correspondent who has been reporting on the country since the 1979 Soviet invasion, writes that there are two wars convulsing Afghanistan: “the war of blood and guts, and the war of truth and lies.”

• President Trump attacks The Times.
Mr. Trump, in a series of tweets, denounced a Times report describing the extensive cooperation between the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, and investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
The president confirmed that he allowed Mr. McGahn, above center, and other officials to cooperate fully with the inquiry, saying he had “nothing to hide.” But Mr. Trump said the Times’s article had falsely insinuated that Mr. McGahn had “turned” on him.

In a statement, The Times said the paper stood by the report and the reporters who wrote it, Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman. In one of his tweets, Mr. Trump called them “two Fake reporters.”

• Faded hope in Turkey.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan once held promise as a potential beacon of democracy for a region rife with religious conflict.
After all, Turkey was a stalwart NATO ally and sought to join the European Union, while Mr. Erdogan presented himself as a moderate and modernizing Muslim leader for the post-9/11 age.

• A nation divided, and in debt.
Imran Khan, the former cricket star turned politician, was sworn in as Pakistan’s prime minister on Saturday, with many wondering whether his campaign rhetoric will match the policies he pursues.
As our South Asia correspondents explain, Mr. Khan’s populist campaign promises “will bump up against the reality that Pakistan’s government has little money to spare, is straddled with debt and must tighten its finances.”
If Mr. Khan completes his five-year term, he would be the first prime minister in Pakistan’s history to do so.

NASA
Chirping crickets. A baby cooing. Crashing waves. A greeting from President Jimmy Carter.
Those were some of the contents of the so-called Golden Record that was attached to NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft, which was launched for Jupiter and Saturn 41 years ago today. Voyager 1, which launched on Sept. 5, 1977, also carries a record.
The spacecraft were designed to explore the outer solar system, but the record (actually made of copper) also carried a message to any extraterrestrials that may find it: sounds and images that best represented humankind and life on Earth. In addition to sounds of nature, there were musical pieces and greetings in 55 languages. Above, the cover of the record.
The astronomer Carl Sagan led the effort to compile the record, an ambitious process that was fraught with indecision. In addition to the technical issues of creating a record that could withstand the pressures of space, there was also the philosophical burden of how to best paint a picture of our planet.
Voyagers 1 and 2 are, respectively, now about 13 billion and 11 billion miles from Earth, carrying the record, which Dr. Sagan called a “bottle in a cosmic ocean.”
