• Calls for a cease-fire in Yemen.
The U.S. and Britain abruptly increased diplomatic pressure on Saudi Arabia, calling for an end to the yearslong conflict between Saudi-led forces and Houthi insurgents in Yemen.
The war has created the world’s worst man-made humanitarian disaster, claiming at least 10,000 lives and pushing millions to the brink of starvation. Read our recent reporting from inside the devastation.
Global criticism of the situation has risen as the Saudis have come under intense scrutiny over the killing of the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last month.
Turkish officials, frustrated by an unproductive visit by a Saudi official this week, abandoned their stream of leaks to media and went on the record for the first time to say that Mr. Khashoggi had been strangled almost immediately after entering the Saudi consulate and then dismembered.

• Pakistan delivers ‘a landmark verdict.’
The country’s Supreme Court acquitted a Christian woman, Asia Bibi, who spent the last eight years on death row for allegedly insulting the Prophet Muhammad. Her release reignited protests across the country.
Laws condemning any insults to Islam were introduced in the 1980s by the country’s former military dictator Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq and have since been criticized internationally for being misused to persecute religious minorities.
Mere allegations of blasphemy can spark mass riots and violence. After Ms. Bibi was convicted in 2010, two senior officials who spoke out for her or in favor of changing the blasphemy laws were shot and killed.

• U.S. pursues controversial weapons.
The Pentagon, worried about the threat posed by North Korea, is pursuing at least three new foreign-made versions of cluster munitions — bombs or rockets that spray smaller weapons over a targeted area. Above, old versions on display in Laos.
The weapons have been condemned by international arms control groups and banned in 102 countries for the indiscriminate harm they can bring to civilians. The new versions, at least theoretically, limit the damage.

The Trump administration cleared the way for the Pentagon by canceling a policy last year that limited the weapons’ use.

• ‘Care to lend a hand?’
That was the plea from a beloved bookstore in southern England facing the daunting task of transporting thousands of books after a rent increase forced it to relocate.
The answer: Hundreds of people showed up to help. They formed a human chain, passing the books along to the new site, about 150 meters away.
One of the store’s few paid employees offered an understated appreciation: “We’ve got a lot of good will in our community.”

The American movie industry established its first ratings system on this day 50 years ago. The series of letter grades replaced what was informally known as the Hays Code, a set of strict “decency” standards.
William Hays was the president of the film industry’s trade organization when the code was written in 1930 to ban profanity, any suggestion of sex and depictions of explicit violence, among other things.
The rules went mostly unenforced until 1934. Facing boycotts by church groups and the threat of federal censorship, Hays appointed an enforcer who could prevent the release of films unless producers complied with the code.
Over the years, objections were raised over everything from the length of Betty Boop’s skirts, above, to the sound of Humphrey Bogart’s stomach growling. Shakespeare wasn’t safe either: A 1944 version of “Henry V” changed a reference from “Norman bastards” to “dastards.”
Some perceived code violations nearly altered movie history: “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn,” Clark Gable’s famous line from “Gone With the Wind,” was almost rewritten because of the word “damn.”
In the 1960s, as social standards changed, filmmakers began to successfully ignore the rules. The new ratings system allowed the industry to shield itself as films became increasingly bold.
