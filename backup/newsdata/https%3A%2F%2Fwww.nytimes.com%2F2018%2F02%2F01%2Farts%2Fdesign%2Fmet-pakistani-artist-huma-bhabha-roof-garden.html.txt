The art installation on the roof of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is always a much-anticipated rite of spring.
This year, the Pakistani artist Huma Bhabha has been selected to create a site-specific work for the roof garden, the sixth in a series of commissions for the outdoor space, which will be on view from April 17 through Oct. 28.
“Huma Bhabha’s work is powerful and arresting, informed by a deep and sophisticated engagement with art history, architectural space, an interest in popular iconographies and keenly responsive to political narratives, both historic and current,” said Shanay Jhaveri, an assistant curator of South Asian art at the Met, “which makes her the right artist at this time for the commission.”
For the multipart installation, “We Come in Peace,” Ms. Bhabha has “choreographed a dramatic mise en scene” of monumental sculptures, Mr. Jhaveri said.

Born in 1962 in Karachi, Ms. Bhabha lives and works in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Using found materials and everyday detritus, the artist explores themes of colonialism, war and displacement.
“The Met’s encyclopedic collection is the perfect stage for Huma’s new works, which are embedded and infused with thousands of years of art historical references and cultural traditions,” said Alissa Friedman, a partner and director of Salon 94, which represents Ms. Bhabha. “With New York City as her theater in the round, her sculptures are anchored in both the present and the past.”
