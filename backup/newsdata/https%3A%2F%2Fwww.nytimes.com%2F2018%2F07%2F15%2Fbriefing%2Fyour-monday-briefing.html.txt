• France!
With a potent mix of greatness, grit and good fortune, France ended an enthralling run by Croatia, 4-2, and claimed its first title since winning on home soil in 1998.
Above, President Emmanuel Macron of France and his wife, Brigitte Macron, celebrated after watching the match with President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic of Croatia and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
As the outcome echoes around the world, we have to ask: Was Russia 2018 the greatest of all World Cups?
And, just for fun, we combined all 163 impassioned cries by Telemundo’s announcers into one lung-bursting “goooooool."

British investigators believe the same military unit those officers served with may also be responsible for the nerve agent attack in Britain against a former Russian spy in March.

• No touching, no nicknames, no sharing food. And it’s better if you don’t cry.
Those are the rules for thousands of migrant children held in U.S. detention centers as they await reunification with their families after crossing the border with Mexico. Above, a 3-year-old after returning to his mother, after four months apart.

The centers range in austerity, from a 33-acre youth shelter to hastily converted motels. But most, our reporters write, are united by the aching uncertainty of children who have no idea when they will see their parents again.

• A staggering amount of gold.
That’s what’s locked in India’s Hindu temples, often just steps from onlookers. The total amount could weigh as much as 8.8 million pounds, worth roughly $160 billion.
Despite their ancient riches, India’s temples are often poorly managed and lacking in security — tantalizing targets for thieves.

President Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia are meeting today in Finland, a country with its own complicated relationship to Russia.
Finland was taken over by the Russian Empire in 1809 after being part of Sweden for almost 700 years. It gained independence in 1917 (the country celebrated its 100th anniversary last December with a national coffee break and patriotic karaoke).
Peace with the newly established Soviet Union did not last, with the two countries fighting two conflicts during World War II. The first was a Soviet invasion called the Winter War, which was fought in temperatures exceeding minus 40. (That conflict inspired The Times to write about the Finnish cultural trait of sisu, calling it a “special kind of strong will.”)
Finland battled the Soviet Union again from 1941 to 1944. Above, Finnish troops in 1941.
As a neutral party in the Cold War, Finland hosted numerous meetings between U.S. and Soviet leaders. But it was careful not to risk its sovereignty by antagonizing its powerful neighbor, a policy Western scholars called “Finlandization.”
Today, Finland and Russia are major trade partners and share a 24/7 military hotline. But Finland still has mandatory military service for men, partly to defend its 833-mile border with Russia. Last year, it increased the size of its military, citing Russian aggression.
